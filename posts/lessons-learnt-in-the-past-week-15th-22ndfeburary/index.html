  <p>One of the clients wanted his site to be remade.</p>
<p>His existing site was wildly outdated, as it was put together hastely. At the time, I was not sure if he wanted a new site or not. But he pays me, I thought I should look out for him, so I whipped up something very simple.</p>
<p>But now, he has a clearer picture of how he wanted the website. He wanted it to be responsive, and probably incorporates a few more slide show images. I figured I might as well make it on wordpress for a faster turn-around. This is when I noticed, except for Zerif-Lite, the customisability of most of the themes are wildly underwhelming. Or perhaps, it’s just I have much more to learn about wordpress.</p>
<p>If anyone can tell me what is the equivalent of modules in wordpress, especially on the front page, I’d be eternally grateful. Or is it that I have to hard code everything on a static front page?</p>
<p>More worryingly, there is one or two themes, where I could not see one of the modules (fullscreen image, in bootstrap, .jumbotron), let alone customise it. Perhaps I should try to use Drupal and that would be more of my liking?</p>
<p>Shout out to the good guys/gals who made <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/zerif-lite/">Zerif-Lite</a>. It is my first venture into the world of wordpress (was using Joomla and then Notepad before that). The amount of features available is incredible. And I almost feel bad bypassing the pay wall by renaming the section id’s. Kudos to them for not tying in CSS format with section id’s.</p>
<hr>
<p>It seems like plugins are the closest thing to modules in WordPress. I should delve into it sometime. For now, a selection of my photography life can be seen at <a href="http://www.pandamakes.com.au/about">here</a>. (That was a shameless plug.)</p>
<hr>
<p>I have had a nice dinner with a couple of good friends of mine. It seems both of them have ideas to get away from their current jobs and start something exciting.</p>
<hr>
<p>Whilst I promised myself I will wait until the arrival of the new laptop before I would start on the Android project, I cannot help but to read up on what needs to be done. I figured I will need <em>OpenCV</em> to recognise the optical trigger, then hopefully, do a free transform to turn the optical information to an image. Then, use <em>OSRA</em> to turn the image into a SMILES or hopefully, directly into a MOL. If the latter cannot happen, I will need <em>openBabel</em> to convert the SMILES into MOL. What I did not realise was MOL is already 3D capable, with x, y and z axis. The rest should be just <em>openGL</em> to render the 3D graphics.</p>
