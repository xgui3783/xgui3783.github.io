It did not disappoint.</p>\n<p>I was already aware of the memory profiler in chrome dev tool, which allow snapshot of heap to be captured and profiled. I was not aware that the memory profiler can be used to profile on a temporal axis (i.e., start recording, do action, stop recording, see all calls to allocate memory).</p>\n<p>I also learnt about <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/memlab\">facebook/memlab</a> and <a href=\"https://clinicjs.org/flame/\">clinicjs</a>. They may be for nodejs applications only, but since chrome devtool allow exporting of the profile result, they can potentially be used to visualize and debug frontend.</p>\n<h2 id=\"javascript-recycle-reuse-rebuild-transformative-tactics-for-turning-your-brownfields-green\" tabindex=\"-1\">Javascript: Recycle, Reuse, Rebuild: Transformative Tactics for Turning your Brownfields Green <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://pandamakes.me/posts/20240207-fosdem-day1/\">#</a></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-3289-recycle-reuse-rebuild-transformative-tactics-for-turning-your-brownfields-green/\">abstract</a></p>\n<p>Frankly, I stayed because I wanted to see the next session.

I was pleasant surprised to find that, there is <em>always</em> more to learn.</p>\n<p>The talk focused mainly on async operations (e.g. Promise, async-await, callback), and how they could still block the main thread, if you are not careful. Since I exclusively used async ops for io-bound task (file read/write, network, etc), I was ready to believe that async tasks would not block the main thread. The speaker used bcrypt to illustrate that CPU bound tasks, even if they are delegated to async operation, could still block the main thread.</p>\n<p>Takeaway: For CPU-bound tasks, use workers.</p>\n<p>(extra: I wonder how/if this also affects EventLoop implementation in python)</p>\n<h2 id=\"open-research-the-french-open-science-monitor-steering-the-science-based-on-open-bibliographic-databases\" tabindex=\"-1\">Open Research: The French Open Science Monitor: steering the science based on open bibliographic databases <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://pandamakes.me/posts/20240207-fosdem-day1/\">#</a></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-3185-the-french-open-science-monitor-steering-the-science-based-on-open-bibliographic-databases/\">abstract</a></p>\n<p>I wanted to join the next session, and I had some time to kill, so I decided to join this session, too.

Just double checking, I did some quick REPL in JS vs python, and they seem to return the same results.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-js\" tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token number\">1</span> <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class=\"token number\">2</span> <span class=\"token comment\">// return 4</span>\n<span class=\"token number\">10</span> <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class=\"token number\">10</span> <span class=\"token comment\">// returns 10240</span></code></pre>\n<p>and in python:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-python\" tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-python\"><span class=\"token number\">1</span> <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class=\"token number\">2</span> <span class=\"token comment\"># returns 4</span>\n<span class=\"token number\">10</span> <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class=\"token number\">10</span> <span class=\"token comment\"># returns 10240</span></code></pre>\n<p>So I naively thought I just had to reimplement the entire function in python. I was wrong. And I had to learn this the hard way.</p>\n<p>In JS, bitwise operation are carried out in int32, but python will use however many additional bits required to represent the number. This means, bitwise operation in JS will overflow (which is fine), bitwise operation in python will not overflow, but simply consume more memory. This also means, if the number gets too large, python and JS bitwise operation will diverse, if one is not careful:</p>\n<p>In JS:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-js\" tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token number\">1</span> <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class=\"token number\">30</span> <span class=\"token comment\">// 1073741824</span>\n<span class=\"token number\">1</span> <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class=\"token number\">31</span> <span class=\"token comment\">// -2147483648</span>\n<span class=\"token number\">1</span> <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class=\"token number\">32</span> <span class=\"token comment\">// 1</span></code></pre>\n<p>In python:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-python\" tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-python\">\n<span class=\"token number\">1</span> <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class=\"token number\">30</span> <span class=\"token comment\"># 1073741824</span>\n<span class=\"token number\">1</span> <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class=\"token number\">31</span> <span class=\"token comment\"># 2147483648</span>\n<span class=\"token number\">1</span> <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class=\"token number\">32</span> <span class=\"token comment\"># 4294967296</span></code></pre>\n<p>The way I dealt with the problem is by casting the result to int32 (since numpy is already a dependency):</p>\n<pre class=\"language-python\" tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-python\"><span class=\"token keyword\">from</span> numpy <span class=\"token keyword\">import</span> int32\nint32<span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token number\">1</span> <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class=\"token number\">30</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token comment\"># 1073741824</span>\nint32<span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token number\">1</span> <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class=\"token number\">31</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token comment\"># -2147483648</span>\nint32<span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token number\">1</span> <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class=\"token number\">32</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token comment\"># 0</span></code></pre>\n<p>PS.</p>\n<p>1/ As I write this, I just noticed the edge case of <code>1 &lt;&lt; 32</code>, and it appears that it has been asked and <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57660143/6059235\">answered</a> before. The hashing code does not use <code>&lt;&lt; 32</code>, so perhaps I am ... still safe? Programming is weird.</p>\n<p>2/ As I am writing this, I noticed the second <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/52171480/6059235\">highest voted answer</a> on the hashing question, make use of <code>Math.imul</code>, which is something I did not know existed. The hashing function has been in production for sometime now, and unfortunately cannot be swapped out, but I will keep what I learnt in mind.</p>\n",

My guess is that protractor internally uses selenium. By specifying the binary executable path, protractor opens a Chrome window. But <code>puppeteer.launch</code> will launch a separate chrome instance. Puppeteer API interacts with the latter and webdriver API interacts with the former. Whilst your tests will still pass/fail as you would expect, debugging them becomes a much more difficult task.</p>\n<p>So I could:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use protractor and learn selenium web driver API</li>\n<li>Use protractor and use puppeteer in effective headless mode</li>\n<li>Use mocha, chai and puppeteer</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After much back and forth, I have decided to use jasmine and selenium. Hopefully, in the future, it should be easier to distribute e2e tests via selenium grid. It should also allow tests to be written in other languages.</p>\n<p>I have abstracted away the selenium webdriver API, so in principle, implementing puppeteer should be relatively simple.</p>\n<h2 id=\"issue-2-debugging-http-requests\" tabindex=\"-1\">Issue 2: Debugging HTTP requests <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://pandamakes.me/posts/2020-02-14-selenium-vs-puppeteer/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>In e2e tests, one of the test conditions is given the navigation to a URL, the application should make a HTTP GET request. For puppeteer, there is <a href=\"https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/blob/master/docs/api.md#pagesetrequestinterceptionvalue\">page.setRequestInterception(value)</a> . For selenium ... nothing?</p>\n<p>At the end, I had to resort to proxy'ing <code>XMLHttpRequest.prototype.open</code>. (edit: the idea came from <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/chmanie/e616ef3b9d20321943e8\">this gist</a>) Even then, it was not straight forward. <code>webdriver.get</code> instantiate a new window for me, and thus overwrites any previous proxying of <code>XMLHttpRequest.prototype.open</code>. So I had to hack it by synchronously patching the method, after <code>webdriver.get</code> call was made.</p>\n",

Any changes to the local node stays local.</p>\n<p>2/ <strong>intersection observer behaves strangely</strong>. I wanted to achieve an infinite scroll effect where only the first 50 or so rows are rendered. As the user scroll to the bottom half, the next 50 are rendered dynamically. My first attempt was to use a <code>slice</code> pipe and dynamically alter the begin and end. But this causes the entire list to rerender, and the result? on render, the viewport is teleported with the added content, to the very bottom. <strong>Solution</strong>: cluster the flattened list into batch of 50, and use <code>*ngIf</code> to hide/show them</p>\n<p>3/ <strong>do not remove elements from the top</strong>. So I thought I'd be clever. User scrolled past the first 50 elements, let's destroy them, so they do not need to be rendered, should speed up the rendering process.

This is not for any NDA reasons – the library is opensource on github). I feel obliged to present my findings here, hopefully in a legible fashion.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Problem 1: the app runs particularly slowly on a chrome browser on my laptop.</p>\n<p>I won’t bore you with the troubleshooting, the verdict is that the browser installed is a 32bit browser. As a result, I is programmed to use only 4 GB (out of the possible 16GB) of RAM, which slowed the process down significantly.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Problem 2: I attempted to reinstall chrome (57.0.2987.110 64bit). This time, chrome identifies my GPU (AMD Radeon R7 M370) as a <a href=\"https://www.khronos.org/webgl/wiki/BlacklistsAndWhitelists\">blacklisted GPU</a>. As a result, chrome refuses to hardware accelerate webgl.</p>\n<p>Solution: I could override the misidentification by going to <code>chrome://flags</code> and enable <code>Override software rendering list</code>. But a simple reinstallation cleared the problem altogether.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Problem 3: The updated chrome (57.0.2987.110 64bit) no longer supports <code>webgl.getExtension(‘WEBGL_draw_buffers’)</code></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pandamakes.me/web/20190303111435im_/https:/pandamakes.com.au/content/images/2018/01/chrome_getExtension_webgl_draw_buffers.PNG\" alt=\"chrome_getExtension_webgl_draw_buffers\"></p>\n<p>Above is the <code>console.log</code> of the method <code>webgl.getExtension(‘WEBGL_draw_buffers’)</code>.

In addition to 57.0.2987.110 64bit, I have also tried their canary build 59.0.3054.0 64bit, which does not support the extension either.</p>\n<p>Addendum: according to <a href=\"https://www.khronos.org/registry/webgl/sdk/tests/conformance/extensions/webgl-draw-buffers.html\">the extension conformance</a>, not supporting <code>WEBGL_draw_buffers</code> is legal.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pandamakes.me/web/20190303111435im_/https:/pandamakes.com.au/content/images/2018/01/notSupportingDrawBuffer_legal.PNG\" alt=\"notSupportingDrawBuffer_legal\"></p>\n",

In the not so distant past, I had to work with my old mouse on glassy surfaces on a few occasions, often with hacks such as using a few sheets of A4 paper as a mouse pad, producing mixed results.Having a mouse that works on most glassy surface can be helpful. However, Logitech MX series does not seem to want to play ball with Notepad++. Horizontal scroll started off being really slow (approx 3 characters at a time).

			"content_html": "<p>Last week, I talked a bit about my initial adventure into three.js. This week, I will continue to share some quirks that I found interesting regarding three.js</p>\n<hr>\n<p>When both dat.gui.min.js and TrackballControl are implemented, altering the dat.gui panel causes the perspective of TrackballControl to change. After all, clicking and dragging in dat.gui panel constitute as a click + drag event. Surely, <a href=\"https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/828\">there is a way to circumvent this</a>. The short answer (by meetar @ github):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For the record, @mrdoob is referring to passing the render context (renderer.domElement) to the controls call, like so:</p>\n<p>controls = new THREE.TrackballControls( camera, renderer.domElement );</p>\n<p>This tells the controls to only work when the mouse is over the renderer’s domElement (the canvas). This change fixed the problems I was having with dat.GUI while using TrackballControls.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My reaction and response, borrowing from amboworld @ github from the same thread:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>thanks @meetar</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<p>Another issue I have had was the <code>.getWorldDirection()</code> method. Long story short, I eventually realised that THREE treats positive x axis direction as the direction to return when the method <code>.getWorldDirection()</code> is called. Instead of redoing the vertices and faces, I used a simple subtracting to figure out the desired direction.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>This is a short one. In order to determine whether the face of a custom geometry is “inside” or “outside”, check the order of the vertices. If the vertices are push in in an anti-clockwise fashion, it is an outside face. If clockwise, then in face. Whether a face is on the outside or inside will affect how is the polygon painted. Of course, you can paint on both sides, and alleviate this problem all together.</p>\n",

Indeed, some of the (essential) characteristics can be implemented at will by including their respective js file(s). For example, one neat extension to include is the <em>TrackballControl.js</em>.

Failure to do so will result in CentOS been booted from the ISO over and over again.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now that the virtual box is setup, all of the work below will be done inside the virtualbox.

The problem is</p>\n<p>pip install pyinstaller</p>\n<p>produces an error, presumably because pyinstaller (latest version) is compatible with python 2.7+. I failed to realise that I could upgrade python to 2.7 without touching the glibc, but this turns out to be a blessing in its own way, as I side stepped the problem, by downloading <a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyInstaller/2.1\">v2.1</a>, which support python2.6.

This created the rather unfortunate event, where in the webhooks, I allowed <strong>five</strong> of the childprocess to spawn their individual instances of the binary. This likely flooded the tmp folder usage. Not only was I unable to get any stdout from the said child processes, I was not able to transfer files via sftp, ssh and execute the binary (‘cannot create directory’, was the error message). Restarting the app does not clear the cache, but</p>\n<p>rhc app-tidy -a appname</p>\n<p>did the trick.</p>\n<p>At the end, I compiled the binary without the <code>-F</code> flag.

			"content_html": "<p>I was asked to do something about the inefficient process of marking MCQ exam papers. This is my adventure trying to get it to work.</p>\n<p>I have written previously about a project where, multiple choice exam papers were marked by an Android app, and the result was sent to the server, where reports can be printed, and marks are tallied. I chose Android to do the bulk of heavy lifting, because I have gotten openCV to work on Android before, and there was not a lot of time to explore other options. However, after a term, the inefficiency of using an Android device is becoming apparent.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Android devices are scarce.</li>\n<li>the app is slow and cumbersome (as it needs to process each frame of the camera)</li>\n<li>the state of the test paper in real life scenarios not only reduce the resolution, but also distorts the geometry</li>\n<li>lighting heavily affects the marking process</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So I was asked if I could do something via the scanned PDFs. Scanned PDFs can alleviate all of the above problems.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Writing the program</strong><br>\nWriting a program to run on my PC was almost too easy. I explored the possibility of detecting rectangles using <code>canny</code> followed by <code>approxdp</code>. They do not seem to work like I would like them to. Contamination from student writings will drastically affect the ability for the program to detect rectangles. At the end, I went with fixed positions given the size of the test paper. Less reliable if the scan was slanted, but, trade-offs.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Making the program run on openshift</strong><br>\nNow this is not so easy. I thought, I could just use PyInstaller, freeze the python into a single file,</p>\n<p>chmod +x executable &amp;&amp; ./executable</p>\n<p>Turns out, in order to compile a linux executable, I need to compile in an linux environment. Annoying, but no biggie, I thought. So I downloaded an Ubuntu ISO (which came with python), fired up <em>VirtualBox</em>, installed <em>openCV</em>, installed <em>pyinstaller</em>, made the executable, made sure everything works fine (input, output, etc).</p>\n<p>I noticed that upon packing into a Linux executable, the performance took quite a significant hit. But no matter, I uploaded the executable (ELF), to the server, changed the permission, and fired it up, to which, I was greeted with the error:</p>\n<p>GLibC 2.14 is needed.</p>\n<p>Of course. It was too easy. I checked my system’s glibc version via</p>\n<p>ldd –version</p>\n<p>turns out to be 2.23. SSH into openshift, its glibc version was 2.12.</p>\n<p>At this stage, I have several options:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>attempt to recompile the ELF with glibc 2.12.</li>\n<li>attempt to update glibc version of openshift/find other hosts that provide glibc version 2.14+</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I briefly entertained with the idea, that if I <a href=\"https://blog.openshift.com/enabling-python-27-on-a-paas-with-the-openshift-diy-app-type/\">updated python from 2.6 to 2.7 on openshift</a>, it might also update the glibc version. Boy was I wrong.</p>\n<p>So I kept the possibility of finding another host at the back of my mind, whilst trying to recompile ELF with glibc 2.12 (or below).</p>\n<hr>\n<p>There are quite a few people who ran into similar problems as me. But <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/847179/multiple-glibc-libraries-on-a-single-host\">solutions</a> all seem rather non trivial. Possibly the most straight forward method is to find a legacy distribution of linux, which still sports glibc2.12, and compile the ELF there.</p>\n<p>I first tried the latest Fedora. glibc2.23, but supposedly with official support of RH. Didn’t work.</p>\n<p>Then, I found <em>CentOS6.x</em> glibc2.12. Bingo, I thought. But pyinstaller would not work. pyinstaller apparently only works with python2.7+. But <a href=\"http://nuitka.net/\">nuitka</a> may work.</p>\n<p>So I installed the prereq’s, installed opencv. Hoping for the best.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Somehow, <code>import cv2</code> could not find module named cv2. According to <a href=\"http://techieroop.com/install-opencv-in-centos/\">this post</a>, I need to copy cv2.so to the working folder of python. But cv2.so does not exist. After much digging, I found <a href=\"http://answers.opencv.org/question/10651/cv2so-missing-after-opencv-installed/\">this post</a>. Case sensitive, flag is accepted. Now it’s building. Hopefully, this time, it works.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The <code>BUILD_opencv_python</code> flag worked (for opencv2.4.13). Now, nuitka it to an ELF. It sure is taking its sweet time.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>nuitka failed to compile, but pyinstaller2.1 worked like a charm… what’s more, the ELF is smaller in size. WIN!</p>\n",

Storing usernames and hashed passwords is a better approach, but still lacks in security. We will talk about salt + hash, which is yet more secure than just hashing the password</p>\n<p>Salt and hash is a method that specifically tries to counter two shortcomings of just hashing the password. Namely, social engineering and rainbow tables. The workflow of salt and hash is the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>on signup, generate a <strong>unique</strong> string of characters for each new user. This random string of characters are known as a <strong>salt</strong></li>\n<li>calculate the hash of a string of characters, containing the password, followed by salt. e.g. if the password is michaeljackson and salt is ao2encm191, then the hash of michaeljacksonao2encm191 will be calculated. This hashed string is known as the <strong>salted hashed password</strong>.</li>\n<li>save the username, salted hashed password and salt into the database</li>\n<li>on signin, find user with the typed username</li>\n<li>calculate the hash of a string of characters, containing typed password followed by database stored salt</li>\n<li>compare the calculated salted hashed password with the stored salted hashed password. If the characters are the same, the authentication succeeds. Otherwise, the authentication fails.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now, should an attacker gain access to your database, this is what they will see:</p>\n<p>username</p>\n<p>password</p>\n<p>salt</p>\n<p>hint</p>\n<p>panda</p>\n<p>7f2f1569adc6df56c79c43526184732a</p>\n<p>wa091k3</p>\n<p>favourite food</p>\n<p>squirrel</p>\n<p>9e99d88df248f42c145924189de77fdd</p>\n<p>91kacx</p>\n<p>thrill</p>\n<p>koala</p>\n<p>c655062d796cfc8c0771ce2299d88b10</p>\n<p>kk1nmo7</p>\n<p>is\\’t my kid</p>\n<p>Squirrel and koala, whilst using the same passwords, have different salted hashed passwords. This can potentially make social engineering answers a lot harder. Additionally, rainbow tables will likely not work, as the tables will need to be millions if not billions if not trillion times larger. The best part is, the salt can be stored in the database in plain text.</p>\n<p>The same caveat applies to the hashing method. Always use the latest hashing algorithms. It matters not if you are using salted hashed passwords, if your system can be compromised by brute force in 5 minutes or less. Modern (2016) computers can calculate MD5 extremely quickly. Use SHA2 (2016) or whichever hashing algorithm that is the standard.</p>\n",

The beauty of hashing algorithms is that, given the same input, using the same hashing algorithm, one will always get the same output. For example:</p>\n<p>md5('coffee is delicious') = acbb7ff2245639a5fb74b7e4896f1c50</p>\n<p>Google any MD5 algorithms, and try to hash ‘coffee is delicious’ (without the single quotes), you will always get <code>acbb7ff2245639a5fb74b7e4896f1c50</code>, regardless time of the day, architecture of the CPU, position of Mercury, etc.</p>\n<p>The workflow of a username/password backend involving hashing algorithms will thus look like the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>retrieve the username/password combination from signup page</li>\n<li>hash the password</li>\n<li>store the username and hashed password as two strings in a database</li>\n<li>when the user signs in, find the record in the database that matches the username input with username in the database</li>\n<li>hash the password input, and compare that with hashed password stored in the database.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Should hashed password database be breached, the intruder will see the following table:</p>\n<p>username</p>\n<p>password</p>\n<p>hint</p>\n<p>panda</p>\n<p>82960335036ff4ddc124b78af7777ee4</p>\n<p>favourite food</p>\n<p>squirrel</p>\n<p>8d38376baca2ecf4196e5e0529f48e48</p>\n<p>thrill</p>\n<p>koala</p>\n<p>8d38376baca2ecf4196e5e0529f48e48</p>\n<p>is\\’t my kid</p>\n<p>Hopefully, one of the problems associated with hashing is becoming clear to you. Both squirrel and koala had michaeljackson as their passwords. As a result, their hashed passwords are the same. With a little social engineering, the intruder can deduce that their password is michaeljackson</p>\n<p>The other problem with hashing password is that whilst in theory, it is extremely difficult to reverse engineer hashed passwords, there are ways to crack hashed passwords:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What is known as ‘rainbow tables’, where popular passwords and their hashed strings have been calculated, and stored in very very very very VERY large spreadsheets. Each of the sheet is known as a rainbow table, which effectively serve as a dictionary, that translates hashed string to plain text passwords.</li>\n<li>Depending on the method of hashing, brute force may be a viable method to break the hashed passwords. At the time of writing, MD5 is <strong>not</strong> a secure hashing algorithm. SHA1 is <strong>not</strong> a secure hashing algorithm. SHA2 is the industry standard for now, but as the computing speed doubles roughly every four years, I am confident that SHA2 will become inadequate in the future, too.</li>\n</ol>\n",

I was hoping screenshots can be neatly presented to showcase the capabilities of each of the webapps I have developed over the last year.</p>\n<p>I first found Robo Gallery. Robo Gallery is stunning, both in terms of the customisability as well as cleanliness of the plugin. But the free version comes with a 3 gallery limit. That was when I realised that most gallery plugins impose a limit on how many galleries you can create before nudging you in the direction of the paid plans. I was relatively happy with robo galleries, but I was not too keen on forking out 99USD to purchase the extended version. After the failed attempt (or rather, just the lack of enthusiasm) at unlocking the gallery limit at 3, I looked into the Gallery + Slideshow functionality offered by Jetpack.</p>\n<p>Jetpack is an in house extension of wordpress developed by Automattic (the creator and maintainer of WordPress, if I am not mistaken). It extends a lot of the existing features of WordPress, by implementing additional features such as site analytics, tiled gallery, lightbox slide shows and so on. Whilst the out of the box slide show did not offer as much customisations, it satisfied my needs. More importantly, it was available at the low low cost of 0AUD.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Now, remember the whole host of extensible functions offered by jetpack? Well, unbeknown to me, one of them was the mobile theme. Jetpack will automatically try to optimise your webpage on a mobile device. This takes place before the responsive themes. I guess this could be a god send for sites that do not use themes that are responsive, it led a panic attack on my part. I had done some PHP hack to remove certain design elements that I was not too fond of. I had thought that it is because the PHP codes were altered, the mobile theme was messed up intentionally by the developers of the theme. After an hour of frantic search and test, the culprit was found. Jetpack. Thou giveth, and thou taketh away.</p>\n",

There are a lot more features I would like to implement in the future, such as<br>\n– a reddit styled voting system, which would give new or upvoted questions more weight when questions are picked randomly<br>\n– a Wikipedia styled editing system, where users can report or submit improvements to the existing questions, and moderators can approve them<br>\n– A Optical character recognition module, which allow questions and suggested answers to be entered into the database by the means of photography<br>\n– an API and a webportal, where homework assignments, exams and quizzes can be generated, submitted and marked online (eventually).</p>\n<p>The greatest benefactors of the app are freelance tutors and newly qualified teachers. They are often faced with tremendous societal and time pressure.</p>\n<p>I created this app a month ago (mid-May 2016) out of the frustration of trying to find and format suitable questions to be set as homework assignments for my students. The existing process is time consuming and tedious partly because it does not take advantage of the information revolution that has taken place.</p>\n<p>I sincerely believe examcopedia can bridge the existing technological chasm within the education sector. In the immediate future, this app can cut down the time required to find the most relevant questions for homework assignments and exams. In the long run, this may be one of the building blocks of the future of education, enabling technologies such as digital personal tutors, e-homework, e-examinations and virtual classrooms.</p>\n<p>So far, I have been the sole developer and sole stakeholder in this webapp. However, I realised that I would not be able to continue the development unaided. Therefore, I am hoping to attain some support from you regarding this project.</p>\n<p>If you can provide direct financial support, allowing me to finish this project, I will be eternally grateful, and will include you as one of the financial sponsors of the app. I estimate that it will take at most two more months of development for the webapp to be release worthy. As a result, if I can raise 2,000 AUD in total, I will be able to carry out this task. If you only wish to pledge a portion of that, I will still be grateful. Anything more than 100AUD, I will include you as a financial sponsor. I will be 100% transparent on all of the financial sponsorship, all of the confirmed donors will appear on my blog and on the official app site. Any amount raised in excess of the 2000AUD required to develop the app will be used to fund my next public good project.</p>\n<p>If you believe that your developers can do a better job, I will be more than happy to give you guys the source codes and the project at its existing state. We can negotiate the terms more thoroughly if you are indeed interested in developing this app.</p>\n<p>If you can offer any technical expertise or marketing help, I will fully appreciate your aid and acknowledge you as a technical supporter of the app.</p>\n<p>Additionally, I will also welcome teachers and tutors who are willing to share their workflow with me. Making the app more user friendly is on the top of my to-do list. I will be more than happy to acknowledge you as an information supporter of the app.</p>\n<p>If you would like to have a sit down conversation with me, feel free to email or leave a message. I will be more than happy to pop into your office or your local cafe for a chat (this offer is only valid for those in Sydney metro region of course).</p>\n",

Just a recap on it’s status:</p>\n<p><code>libimago_c.so</code> provided by Epam does not work out of the box. It is compiled on Linux x86/x64, whereas android uses an ARM architecture. I needed to recompile it using ndk. Before the brief detour, I was having trouble recompiling the source files, because … well, the ndk could not find string.h. Turns out, there is a library of <a href=\"http://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/cpp-support.html\">helper runtimes</a>, that incorporates standard libraries. The one I needed was:</p>\n<p>//Application.mk\nAPP_STL := gnustl_static\nAPP_CPPFLAGS += -fexceptions</p>\n<p>There was a “wha??” moment a little bit later on, relating to opencv. While compiling, one of the module required <code>opencv2/opencv_module.hpp</code>. I ended up finding it in the android sdk of opencv. Let’s hope it works just fine.</p>\n<p><code>dirent.h</code> -&gt; the one that came with imago required <code>windows.h</code>. I am not compiling for a windows machine, and turns out, if I just removed dirent.h from the compiling folder, android ndk can find the suitable dirent.h. How fitting.</p>\n<p>Now, I remember I had to deal with problems associated with <code>windows.h</code> before. I think perhaps it was only strictly needed on a windows compiler? So I guess I can safely take the file out? The issues we are dealing with here is Imago1.0 <code>lock_win.cpp</code>.</p>\n<p>Just my luck. I thought I had hit a wall yesterday, with the superatom_expansion.cpp requiring indigo, and indigo requiring <em>SYSV IPC</em>, I had tweaked the said cpp file, so that it will always return the input without doing anything, thereby bypassing the requirement of indigo. This allowed me to compile imago2.0 with no issue so far. except for mips64, where there was a <code>variable tracking size limit exceeded</code> error. Also, <code>log_ext.cpp $lu expected long unsigned int, but instead had unsigned int as input</code>. Just warnings though. So far, nothing had failed to compile.</p>\n<p>Had some problems with java.awt. Android does not support awt natively. But lucky for me, the part of Imago that uses awt reads buffered image, which I did not need. I only needed png reader.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>As I was waiting for boost-for-android to be setup, link-hopping led me down a strange rabbit hole. Python webapp (newly created on openshift and cloned via git) &gt; what is wsgi (webserver gateway interface) &gt; google app engine uses wsgi. Oh, I wonder if google provide similar services to AWS &gt; google translate api (wow proprietary softwares are really expensive) &gt; I wonder if there are any opensource solutions out there? &gt;<a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15108313/in-need-of-an-open-source-text-language-translation-api\">this thread on SO</a> &gt; what is phonegap &gt; excitement</p>\n<p>The ability to translate HTML/CSS/JS into x platform apps is a nerd’s dream come true.

			"content_html": "<p>The timetable app is in shambles.</p>\n<p>Let me talk a little about the background of the timetable app. It first started as a visual basic/excel app. Very quickly, it became obvious that the slowness was just not going to cut The lack of portability (master file needed), the lack of customisation (prettiness) and the clunkiness of the excel/VB app just does not cut it. So some time Sep ’15, I pitched to my client of a web based timetable app. I built a prototype, and started working on the actual web app. Turned out, I learnt PHP and MySQL building the webapp, which I am eternally grateful. However, the app is showing its age. the codes are ugly, the site is slow, and full of bugs. It’s time to retire the site and make a new one.</p>\n<p>This time, I am planning to use <em>bootstrap</em> for the layout, <em>node.js</em> for real time update on the database and <em>angular js</em> for binding the front end. I believe <em>Ruby on rails</em> would do similar thing as node.js. I was just lazy, and didn’t want to learn ruby unless absolutely necessary.</p>\n<p>node.js quirk #1:</p>\n<p>app.get('/', function (req,res){\nres.sendFile('index.html');\n});</p>\n<p>returns an error:</p>\n<p>TypeError: res.sendFile is not a function</p>\n<p>So I was scratching my head, trying to identify the error, until I saw <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28787518/undefined-error-while-trying-to-route-to-client-folder-using-express\">link</a>, which is in contrary to other <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26202150/express-js-error-express-deprecated-res-sendfile-use-res-sendfile-instead\">SO answers</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.tutorialspoint.com/nodejs/nodejs_express_framework.htm\">example</a>.</p>\n<p>More quirk on node.js and socket.io. So I was testing the server client connection using socket.io, following the example <a href=\"http://socket.io/get-started/chat/\">here</a>. But I thought I’d add my own little flavour, namely instead of</p>\n<p>socket.emit('chat message','foo')</p>\n<p>I would use</p>\n<p>socket.emit('ping','foo')</p>\n<p>Whilst the <code>io.on(‘connection’,’foo’)</code> fired correctly, the <code>socket.emit(‘ping’,’foo’)</code> refuse to fire. I double/triple checked the spelling, and there does not seem to be any typos present. And suddenly, a flicker of brilliance, I though to myself, ping is a common connection term, maybe it’s reserved for special functions, like ‘connection’, and lo and behold, changing <code>ping</code> to <code>ping pong</code> solved my issue.</p>\n<p>ONWARDS, COMRADES! I am stoked.</p>\n<p>More Node.js quirks. I installed mysql via npm, for record control. But somehow, I was not able to connect according to the <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql\">documented method</a>. What happened was, I was thrown the error</p>\n<p>Error: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND</p>\n<p>Before anyone asks, I have restarted my node.js server, and made sure the xampp mysql server is up, at the right (3306) port. Well, either way, when I came back home, it worked. So who knows what happened. It’s likely that I did not have an internet connection, though all of the dependencies are installed locally, so I couldn’t see if there is anything else I needed.</p>\n<p>More quirkiness with jquery this time around.</p>\n<p>//$('#'+i.hashed_id).remove(); //does not work\n$('div').remove('#'+i.hashed_id); //works</p>\n<p>What’s the deal?</p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p>I have uncovered a few more new discoveries in the passing week.</p>\n<p>Firstly, loading the app into my Android phone drastically improved the performance of the app. I suspect this had something to do with the amount of virtual RAM that I have allotted to the Virtual Machine.</p>\n<p>Secondly, I found out the reason for the weird colouration of the rgba output of the preview frame. The problem had something to do with how the frame is encoded and decoded. In short, the problem is non-existent on actual android devices, and only becomes a problem in virtual machines.</p>\n<p>Thirdly, one thing that annoyed me a great deal was how OpenCV seems to fetch a 600×480 rectangle. More annoyingly, the onCameraFrame method has to return a Mat object with the same dimension as the one initialised at onCameraViewStarted(int width, int height). Any other dimension, the camera preview will display black, not even a cropped image. Another quirk I found was that the Imgproc.Canny operation automatically converts a Mat object to a greyscale Mat object, even if it was initialised as <code>CvType.CV_8UC4</code>.</p>\n<p>What else, so much changes between versions. I believe I have already talked about <code>Core.line</code> vs <code>Imgproc.line</code>. There is also now <code>CV_RGB2GRAY</code> vs <code>Imgproc.COLOR_RGB2GRAY</code>. I guess I have learnt to search for the right version.</p>\n<p>More things learnt along the way: when compiling a List , such as Imgproc.findContours, the return results gets appended to the old one. So unless one does a <code>List.clear();</code>, the list will grow larger and well… with devastating consequences. (For one, if one wishes to search through all of the geometric shapes that fits the bill, and at frame 1 finds it at, say pt1, pt2, p3, but at frame 2, the camera had moved, so the frame finds it at pt4, pt5, pt6, the array will remember both elements. If you are to colour the shapes, you get a trail of geometric shapes, essentially).</p>\n<p>Looking around me now, there seems to be a lot of buzzwords appearing in web development. RESTful seems to be thrown around a lot, seemingly out of nowhere. And then, there was <em>AngularJS</em>, <em>NodeJS</em>, <em>React</em> etc. It is quite scary. Am I ever going to catch up?</p>\n<p>Having just looked at SASS + Compass… I have to say, it’s really really REALLY exciting to learn.</p>\n",

Of course, I do not have access to SSL encryption or two factor authentication, but the least I could do is salting and hashing the password. This way. I also added a security token whenever users login, so that they cannot just modify the cookie and gain admin rights. I fully understand this will only protect against internal attacks, and useless against man-in-the-middle attack, but, it might be the best I can do for now. I got it done early, only to be greeted by a bug, that overwrite the last timetable. long story short, I was trolled by <code>if (a = b) {do something}</code> amatuer mistake.</p>\n<p>I had some time, so I also made a tutorial layer. When get a chance, I really should improve on the design aspect. The tutorial layer looks decent, but the handwriting was crap.</p>\n<p>Regardless, the app is behind me now. Refocusing on opencv project. First order of business: figuring out what to do with the mat object in opencv.</p>\n<p>So it seems <code>Core.line</code> has been deprecated. Imgproc.line is to be used. Which certainly means it helps to read which documentation I should be reading.</p>\n<p>Also, in opencv, it seems Houghlines gives lines in terms of rho and theta, whereas HoughlinesP gives results in terms of x1,y1, x2, y2. The latter is what I need.</p>\n<p>It seems processing every frame is too cpu intensive. To lessen the load, I added a line which would only process cpu when it has been two seconds since the last process.</p>\n",

I have encountered problem of course.</p>\n<p>Firstly, there was the issue of Android Studio not recognising hardware.camera, and threw me a number of errors. Turns out, I needed to update the target SDK across different build.gradle files.</p>\n<p>More significantly, I was thrown the error that the app could not have access to the camera.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pandamakes.me/web/20190303112856im_/https:/pandamakes.com.au/content/images/2018/01/notworkingss.png\" alt=\"notworkingss\"></p>\n<p>Digging for an answer online, they seem to suggest that I needed to declare the permission to use camera in android manifest (which I did), and check if other apps are using the camera (they are not, since the native camera app works fine). And very coincidentally, when the emulator told me that I had not enough (virtual) space, and when I am trying to uninstall some early iterations of the app, did I notice that I had to manually give the app permission to use the camera.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pandamakes.me/web/20190303112856im_/https:/pandamakes.com.au/content/images/2018/01/workaround.png\" alt=\"workaround\"></p>\n<p>And suddenly, it works!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pandamakes.me/web/20190303112856im_/https:/pandamakes.com.au/content/images/2018/01/workingss.png\" alt=\"workingss\"></p>\n<p>Next step, messing with the Mat variables so that it can recognise border symbol.</p>\n<p>Next next step, free transform the image and integrate osra + openbabel and output mol file</p>\n<p>final step, 3d rendering of the mol file in opengl.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>And suddenly, an interruption. I was asked to modify a resource management that I created long ago with html/css/js/jquery/php/mysql. It was clear what the client wanted. I have a good idea of how I would proceed. But this meant I will need to put the android opencv project to a halt. That being said, it is a good time to give the webapp a facelift. Although it did what it supposedly did, it has a face only its mother (me) would love.</p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p>One of the clients wanted his site to be remade.</p>\n<p>His existing site was wildly outdated, as it was put together hastely. At the time, I was not sure if he wanted a new site or not. But he pays me, I thought I should look out for him, so I whipped up something very simple.</p>\n<p>But now, he has a clearer picture of how he wanted the website. He wanted it to be responsive, and probably incorporates a few more slide show images. I figured I might as well make it on wordpress for a faster turn-around. This is when I noticed, except for Zerif-Lite, the customisability of most of the themes are wildly underwhelming. Or perhaps, it’s just I have much more to learn about wordpress.</p>\n<p>If anyone can tell me what is the equivalent of modules in wordpress, especially on the front page, I’d be eternally grateful. Or is it that I have to hard code everything on a static front page?</p>\n<p>More worryingly, there is one or two themes, where I could not see one of the modules (fullscreen image, in bootstrap, .jumbotron), let alone customise it. Perhaps I should try to use Drupal and that would be more of my liking?</p>\n<p>Shout out to the good guys/gals who made <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/zerif-lite/\">Zerif-Lite</a>. It is my first venture into the world of wordpress (was using Joomla and then Notepad before that). The amount of features available is incredible. And I almost feel bad bypassing the pay wall by renaming the section id’s. Kudos to them for not tying in CSS format with section id’s.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>It seems like plugins are the closest thing to modules in WordPress. I should delve into it sometime. For now, a selection of my photography life can be seen at <a href=\"http://www.pandamakes.com.au/about\">here</a>. (That was a shameless plug.)</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I have had a nice dinner with a couple of good friends of mine. It seems both of them have ideas to get away from their current jobs and start something exciting.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Whilst I promised myself I will wait until the arrival of the new laptop before I would start on the Android project, I cannot help but to read up on what needs to be done. I figured I will need <em>OpenCV</em> to recognise the optical trigger, then hopefully, do a free transform to turn the optical information to an image. Then, use <em>OSRA</em> to turn the image into a SMILES or hopefully, directly into a MOL. If the latter cannot happen, I will need <em>openBabel</em> to convert the SMILES into MOL. What I did not realise was MOL is already 3D capable, with x, y and z axis. The rest should be just <em>openGL</em> to render the 3D graphics.</p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p>I was asked to do an shortie over the weekend. The client wanted a way to pull four random images (one from each of the four folders) into a collage.</p>\n<p>Initially I wanted to use JS and HTML, since I am already familiar with the language. But as there are no easy way to find the number of files without resorting to server side language, and the aim was to make the process as painless as possible, I decided to look into python.</p>\n<p>After a brief search, it seems I could use ReportLab to generate a PDF and pull images at the same time. There are some languages I might need to learn, but ultimately it was not too difficult. That was when, I hit my first road block.</p>\n<p>Picking up python 3.x was a bad idea.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Attempting to install reportlab to python3.x was not successful. I was confronted with a missing vcvarsall.bat error. After much digging, it seems this is likely the result of Visual C/C++ compiler incompatibility. One of the suggested fix was to use MinGW, an open sourced C/C++ compiler. I did, and it did not turn out better. I was thrown an error for “unknown compiler version error”. Frustrated I was, I decided to forgo reportlab and try to just use python image library and get the job done. PIL installer alerted to me that it could not find python 2.x, and refuse to be installed. This raised the possibility of the lack of backwards compatibility of python 2.x and python 3.x.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So I uninstalled python 3.x and installed python 2.7. And lo and behold, not only did PIL install without a glitch, reportlab did, too.</p>\n<p>There was a small hiccup when I was trying to convert .py to .exe. Clearly, clients do not have python installed, nor do they have environmental variable PATH set as <code>C:/PythonXY</code>. Py2exe did not work for me. But then again, I could have accidentally attempted to launch the .exe in <code>/build/</code>. PyInstaller worked, and the single file made it much easier.</p>\n",

Instead, one must use <code>&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;</code>. (In fact, the exercise of typing the last line is more fun indeed.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>edit 2018-1-7: now that I have migrated to <em>ghost</em>, backticks escapes special characters.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But I digress. Continuing on from the last part.</p>\n<p>29thJan16, Here’s what I wrote:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Problems as soon as I loaded xampp and loaded the font page. Flex box is broken. After much trouble shooting, it seems <code>flex-basis</code> is not exactly the same as <code>width</code>. The problem is that without setting <code>width</code> (or perhaps <code>max-width</code>), the browser automatically sets the width to be 2000px, thus stretching out the entire div. (original design had 3 child-divs in a parent div).</li>\n<li>Second problem: I changed the PHP file, and now, the update and delete button in virtuemart cart no longer works.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Firstly, I stumbled across this thread: <a href=\"http://forum.virtuemart.net/index.php?topic=111410.0\">VM Forum</a>, and the solution (try a different theme) works. This narrowed the problem. So I was sure it was one of the modification I did to the PHP that ruined it. The problem is, I made so many modifications, and every one of them seems plausible. and I was not willing to undo my hours of work.Then, when I was comparing the directory and file differences between the theme that works and the one that does not work, I found this line of code:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a class=\"vmicon vm2-remove_from_cart\" title=\">?php echo JText::_ ('COM_VIRTUEMART_CART_DELETE') ?>\" align=\"middle\" href=\"https://pandamakes.me/posts/catching-up-with-the-past-wisdom-11th-feb-16/%3E\">\n</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>which led me to <code>joomla/components/com_virtuemart/assets/js/dynupdate.js</code>, which was included in the header. I felt at the time, on line 165 was the key, as it described a function <code>Virtuemart.updDynFormListener</code>. I inserted a <code>console.log</code> to try to catch the activation of the codes, and it seems for the theme that works, it is triggered twice and for one that does not work, it is triggered once.<br>\nAnd so, the mystery continues. Checked the source codes for the theme that worked and theme that does not work, they are identical.<br>\nOk, false alarm, the <code>find('[*data-dynamic-update=&quot;1&quot;]')</code> finds only 2 items, the checkout button and the shipping/billing address button. This is why on the one that works, it triggers twice.<br>\nat long last, <code>vmsite.js</code>, let’s hope it’s not another false alarm.<br>\nhmm… bizarre. The console.log seems to trigger on page load…</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ok, I am an idiot… When I was changing the PHP codes around, I moved the <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> to AFTER the update/delete button. So the update/delete buttons. I could only imagine the event listener was attached via the <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> tag. I moved it to a better place, and it is working as intended.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1stFeb16, played around with Akeeba. Successfully moved the site from localhost to its new home online. This can allow my client to see the final product. Somehow forgot the username and password for the old MySql database. After several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to create a new one. The old db had nothing in it. I should drop it when I get a chance.</li>\n</ul>\n",

You cannot spell therapist without rapist.</li>\n<li>In JQuery, one can apply <code>$()</code> selector to select multiple levels of children, but <code>.children()</code> selector only affects a single level. - Corollary: in order to select an element with a specific set of classes (e.g. <code>&lt;div class=&quot;pickme imtherealone&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pickme&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code><br>\n), remove the spaces (e.g. use <code>$('.pickme.imtherealone')</code></li>\n<li>bootstrap looks easy and useful - I have since went through bootstrap and put it to some good use. Still need more practice</li>\n<li>When customising the a module in Joomla in css, always use element.classname or element.id. For example, the ul element is typically used for menu’s. (This should have been in HTML/CSS 101. But still made the mistake.)</li>\n<li><code>box-sizing:border-box</code> is an amazing way to define div sizes.</li>\n<li>In JS or JQuery, always quotation marks for properties. For example, use <code>.css('border-width','24px')</code> rather than <code>.css(border-width,24px)</code>. Again, this should have been HTML/JS 101. - One exception to this rule is if the value is a number, say <code>variable = 1024</code>, then one need not quote the number.
